HELLO ENCRYPT THINGS
====================

Encrypt text with bitcoin addresses.

INSTALL
-------

    pip install hec

I'll try to get some windows and linux binaries up soon.

RUN
---

    hecs.py

INFO
----

I copied all the encryption stuff from encrypt from https://github.com/planetbeing/bitcoin-encrypt.
I made this as a learning exercise, I have no idea if it works.

I kinda want to add the option to chain together a bunch of AES finalists for EXTRA CRYPTO POWER.
